The code is well documented, but I'm adding this readme for Git Hub and anyone coming to my code on there.

This is an amortization table for home mortgages, but it should work for anything else that follows that type of math - say a car loan.

Right now it outputs to a .csv file for importing into a spreadsheet.

If you create a file called extraprinciple you can put numbers with each line representing a month of extra principle payments.  Put a 0 for months without extra principle paid off.
